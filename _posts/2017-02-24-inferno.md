[Inferno](https://infernojs.org/) is rather like Preact in that it takes a subset of React functionality and focuses mostly on the view layer by doing fast rendering. In terms of size and functionality it triangulates between Preact at the low end and React at the high-end. It has synthetic events so it is closer to React than Preact.

The thing that is distinctively enjoyable about Inferno is that while is supports class-based React Components it also supports functional components, allowing for more interesting ways of defining components.

It also allows different VNode generators to be plugged in, allowing you a choice of how you want to generate your virtual DOM.
