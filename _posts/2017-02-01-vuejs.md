# VueJS

VueJS has gained a lot of popularity in a short period of time. As a framework it is relatively lightweight, focussing on DOM rendering and manipulation, data modelling and events. It feels like a spiritual heir to frameworks like Knockout but also takes ideas from RiotJS and React amongst others.

It also has a reasonable community and a number of good learning resources around it.

## Strengths

VueJS is surprisingly versatile while being moderately opinionated. It is easy to drop a global script on a page and do a little bit of dynamic customisation, it also does a reasonable job of providing SPA functionality.

Its component model is robust and provides good separation and composition.
