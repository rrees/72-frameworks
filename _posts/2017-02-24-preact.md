[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a lightweight take on React that serves as an unofficial fork. It focuses just on rendering and components. It also introduces a light wrapper around [Hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) to make it easier to develop without [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) if you want.

Coding with Preact is essentially doing what you would do in React only without certain features. Almost all the documentation describes the framework by reference to how problems would be solved in React. That means the framework lacks a really good set of demos and tutorials in its own right.
