[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a lightweight take on React that serves as an unofficial fork. It focuses just on rendering and components. It also introduces a light wrapper around [Hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) to make it easier to develop without [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) if you want.

Coding with Preact is essentially doing what you would do in React only without certain features. Almost all the documentation describes the framework by reference to how problems would be solved in React. That means the framework lacks a really good set of demos and tutorials in its own right.

## Components

Preact uses ES2015 classes as the core of its component model. This results in some faffing around with `this` and a need to understand what state is being held on the instance and what resides in the state of the object. The rule of thumb seems to be that only things used in the rendering of the component count as state and the rest is instance data.

## Events

Preact doesn't support synthetic events and instead uses event listeners. There doesn't seem to be any practical difference in modern browsers so this seems like a sensible choice.
