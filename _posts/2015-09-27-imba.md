# Imba

[Imba](http://imba.io/) takes an unusual approach to the framework situation by creating a whole new language that incorporates React's concept of components with Ruby-style inheritance.

Imba compiles into Javascript and I wasn't really sure whether it was fair to describe it is a framework based on a DSL or whether it constituted a language that was being put into service to develop SPAs rather like Elm. The thing that persuaded me is that the HTML fragments and components are central to the proposition and the compilation step is really no different to things like Riot that require a compilation from HTML fragments to Javascript.
