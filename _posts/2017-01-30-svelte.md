# Svelte

Rich Harris is a Javascript wizard who has already created the build tool [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and the framework [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive). So therefore when he announced [a new framework called Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) I definitely wanted to take a look and see what problems he is trying to tackle with it.

## Compilation

A key feature of Svelte is that it uses compilation. The framework is used to create a deployable Javascript file in a variety of formats.

## It's just HTML

Svelte components are defined using templated HTML, behaviour is defined via use of the *script* tag and appearance via the *style* tag. The entire component definition sits within one HTML file. The result is that Svelte components feel much more comprehensible than other frameworks that are more abstract and use their own syntax for definitions.
