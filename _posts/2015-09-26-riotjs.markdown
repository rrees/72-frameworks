# RiotJS

[Riot](http://riotjs.com/) is quite heavily influenced by the concept of the web components and things like Polymer but aims to be a more lightweight take on the same concept.

Like Web Components it allows for state to be packed into components and relationships between parent and child components are complex.

Riot has had many moments but has never really seemed to gain mainstream acceptance.
