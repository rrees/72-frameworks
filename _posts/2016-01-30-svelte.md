# Svelte

Rich Harris is a Javascript wizard who has already created the build tool [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and the framework [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive). So therefore when he announced [a new framework called Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) I definitely wanted to take a look and see what problems he is trying to tackle with it.

## Compilation

A key feature of Svelte is that it uses compilation. The framework is used to create a deployable Javascript file in a variety of formats.
