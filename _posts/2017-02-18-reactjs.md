# React and Redux

React is wildly popular so I'm not going to both saying much about what it is and how it works. What I'm more interested in is are the quirks of the framework.

Personally I don't think it is worth considering React without Redux. React's release by Facebook resulted in something that was mostly a rendering technology but still had a prehensile tail of other functionality. In particular handling the state of components was vital to the rendering but incoherent.

I was excited when React was released but now I wouldn't use it in my hobby projects because it is too big and complicated and the speed and reliability offers it makes have larger set the bar for the newer wave of simpler frameworks.
